        <p>This project was developed as part of a computer science course to enhance our understanding of various system-building aspects. 
            The primary goals included creating data storage through the use of JSON for saving and loading data, 
            learning about user interface design using graphical user interfaces (GUIs), and event logs. The assignment involved designing a user-friendly 
            interface that supported functionalities such as adding items to a list and creating new entries.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Project Description</strong></p>
        <p>Within this application, users will be able to look up political candidates of their local riding in Vancouver 
        for the 2023 municipal election. The application will store candidates' information, platform, party affiliation, 
        and other information regarding the policy reforms they are running on. Users will be voters across Vancouver 
        interested in seeing and learning about the candidates they want to vote for. Users can look for specific candidates 
        and their policies or look up information regarding party information and all the candidates running under certain 
        parties. Furthermore, since it is a local election, candidates of the community (or their party) can add 
        themselves/candidates to the kiosk and input their political information.</p>
