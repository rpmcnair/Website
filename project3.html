    <!-- Intro -->
    <p><h3>Project Overview</h3></p>
    <p>This project was developed as part of the CPSC Relational Database course at UBC to design a relational database system that efficiently manages various aspects of a ski resort. </p>
    <p><h3>Project Description</h3></p>
    <p>Ski resort management involves handling guest information, equipment rentals, lift ticket sales, ski lessons, dining services, and 
        ski infrastructure. The goal of this database is to optimize resort operations and provide structured, accessible data for different 
        stakeholders, including ski instructors, management, and maintenance teams. </p>
    <p>The project began with an ER diagram, where key entities were identified, relationships between tables were established, and 
        functional dependencies were defined to normalize the database. After the initial database design, a Relational Schema was developed 
        to define cardinality relationships, ISA hierarchies, and weak entities.</p>    
    <p>The relational schema was implemented using DDL (Data Definition Language) CREATE TABLE statements, and INSERT statements were used 
        to populate the database. Those statements can be found in a PDF at the bottom of this page. Once the database structure was 
        finalized, SQL queries were written to retrieve specific details. Finally, a frontend user interface was developed to allow resort 
        staff to interact with the system and manage operations defined by the queries. </p>

    <!-- ER Diagram -->   
    <p> The following image is the ER diagram that the project follows: </p>

    </div>
    <p><h3>Key Functionalities</h3></p>
    <p>- Patron & Ski Instructor Management: Tracks guest details, ski lesson enrollments, and instructor availability. </p>
    <p>- Lift & Run Status Tracking: Enables efficient scheduling of maintenance and lift/runs tracking.</p>
    <p>- Class Scheduling & Reservations: Helps instructors plan and monitor ski classes.</p>    
    <p>- Lift Ticket & Restaurant Integration: Offers a way to manage season passes, day tickets, and restaurant discounts.</p>    
    <p>- Data Analytics: Supports queries like aggregations, joins, and projections to extract insights for resort decision-making.</p> 
    
    <!-- Queries -->
    <h3>Queries</h3>
    <p>The following images demonstrate various queries implemented in the database and their functionality.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>This project successfully implemented a relational database system to manage ski resort operations efficiently. 
    By leveraging SQL queries, the system enables structured data retrieval and management for various aspects such as rentals, patrons, ski instructors, and lift operations.
    The combination of entity-relationship modeling, database normalization, and front-end integration allows different stakeholders to access and modify data as needed.
    This project highlights the practical applications of database management in real-world scenarios and serves as a strong foundation for further improvements and scalability.</p>
