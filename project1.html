            <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
            <p>With a background in political science and a current focus on computer science, I am very interested in the 
                intersection of these fields. This project aims to integrate statistical modeling techniques within a 
                political framework.</p>

            <p>The primary objective of this project was to develop a predictive model capable of estimating voter turnout 
                for the 2020 US presidental election. Recognizing the complexity of voter behavior, this model considers various factors 
                that could potentially influence turnout rates across different states. Based on comprehensive research, 
                the study identified six key variables that might affect these rates. The variables were selected after 
                thorough analysis of several datasets and scholarly sources, all of which are cited below.</p>

            <p>I set out to answer the following questions: 
                <ol>- Is there a significant relationship between the varaible Voter Turnout 2020 and the other socio-economic and political factors?</ol>
                <ol>- How do various political factors help predict voter turnout rates in 2020?</p></ol>
                
            
            <p><strong>Data Set</strong></p>
            <p>Here is a detailed look at each variable considered in the model:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Diversity Index:</strong> This index measures the probability that two randomly selected 
                    individuals from a state belong to different racial or ethnic groups, using data from the U.S. Census 
                    Bureau (2020).</li>
                <li><strong>Eduction Index:</strong> I constructed this index by integrating several educational metrics:
                    high school dropout rates, the percentage of individuals with higher education diplomas,
                    and adult literacy rates (for those aged 15 and older). The index is calculated as follows:</li>

                    </div>
                <li><strong>Economic Index:</strong> This index was developed to gauge the economic 
                    well-being of each state by combining unemployment rates, poverty levels, and median 
                    household income.</li>
                    <div class="project-content">
                        <img src="images/economic_index.png" alt="Economic_Index" style="width: 500px; height: auto;">
                    </div>
                <li><strong>Voter Turnout Rate 2016:</strong> Voter turnout data calculates the precentage of eligable
                    voters from each state who voted in the 2016 election. It was obtained from the  United States 
                    Elections Project (2016).</li>
                <li><strong>Polarization Variance:</strong> Measures the level of political polarization among residence 
                    in each state. Calculated by using enthropy measure on categorical variables, where respondents of each state
                    indicated there level of political preference. </li>
                <li><strong>Protest per 100k:</strong> The number of protests in each state per 100,000 citizens. </li>
                <li><strong>Voter Turnout Rate 2020 (Response):</strong> Voter turnout data calculates the precentage of eligable
                    voters from each state who voted in the 2020 election. It was obtained from the  United States 
                    Elections Project (2020).</li>
            </ol>

            <p>With these variables I created a heat map to see the correlation between these predictor variables and 
                the response variables (Voter Turnout 2020). 
            </p>

            <p>Figure 2 visualizes the association between the response variable and its six numerical explanatory 
                variables. The response variable voter_turnout_2020 has a relatively strong association with
                voter_turnout_2016, economic_index, and education_index. </p>

            <p><strong>Methods and Results</strong></p>
            <p><i>Overview</i></p> 
            <p> To predict 2020 voter turnout rates, I utilize the forward selection algorithm and ridge regression 
                method on the training set, selecting the most optimal model. Subsequently, I assess the model's 
                performance on the testing data based on the chosen model.</p>
            
            <p>Why is forward selection algorithm chosen?
                The Forward Selection technique can simplify models and prevent overfitting by aiding in model 
                simplification. It starts with no predictors and adds them one by one, choosing at each step the 
                variable that has the most significant statistical contribution to the model.</p>

            <p>Why is Ridge method chosen?
                From the EDA section, I suspect the presence of multicollinearity. While traditional linear regression 
                can yield unstable and imprecise coefficient estimates, the introduction of a penalty term can shrink the 
                coefficients, stabilizing the model and mitigating the issue of multicollinearity.</p>
            
            <p><i>Testing and Training</i></p>
            <p>Initially, I acquired a training and a testing set by reserving 40% of the original dataset for testing 
                purposes, this data set is relatively small so the split is conservative. I further refrain from inspecting 
                the testing set until after the model selection process is completed. </p>

            <p><i>Foward Selection</i></p>
            <p>To estimate the predictive performance of the selected model, I utilized cross-validation with both 
                forward selection and ridge regression. Beginning forward selection:</p>
                <div class="project-content">
                    <p>Figure 3:</p>
                    <img src="images/cross-validation.png" alt="MSE of CV for FS" style="width: 700px; height: auto;">
                </div>
            <p>I calculate the average across the columns of this matrix to produce a vector. In this vector, the i-th 
                element represents the cross-validation error for the i-th variable model.</p>
                <div class="project-content">
                    <p>Figure 4:</p>

                </div>
            <p>The 3-variable model has the lowest mean of the cross-validation error. Corresponding with the 
                RMSE in figure 5.</p>
                <div class="project-content">
                    <p>Figure 5:</p>
                    <img src="images/RMSE_fs.png" alt="RMSE FS" style="width: 700px; height: auto;">
                </div>
            <p><i>Ridge Regression</i></p>
            <p>I trained the ridge regression model using the same training set that was used for forward selection. 
                Notably, the model demonstrates optimal performance when the lambda value is set at 0.06738, corresponding 
                to the lowest mean squared error (MSE). For a comprehensive comparison, I have included the root mean 
                squared error (RMSE) from the cross-validation of the ridge model in the summary table alongside the 
                results from the forward selection method.</p>
                <div class="project-content">
                    <img src="images/ridge_mse.png" alt="RMSE FS" style="width: 700px; height: auto;">
                </div>
            <p>Employing RMSE as the metric for model performance assessment, the ridge regression method exhibits 
                marginally better predictive accuracy compared to other models tested. Given its effectiveness, I will 
                use ridge regression to estimate the influences of different predictors and understand their contribution 
                to the model, although it will not explicitly select variables.</p>
            <p><i>Creating the Model</i></p>
            <p>To construct the most robust model for predicting voter turnout in 2020, I combined insights from both 
                forward selection and ridge regression techniques. Initially, forward selection identified the most 
                statistically significant predictors. Subsequently, ridge regression was employed to refine these 
                selections by adjusting for multicollinearity, which is crucial given the interdependencies often present 
                in economic and demographic data. The final model was an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, which 
                incorporated the variables deemed most important through our rigorous selection process. This model not 
                only benefits from the simplicity and interpretability of OLS but also from the enhanced predictor 
                selection process that effectively balances the inclusion of important variables while managing 
                multicollinearity. This approach ensures that our model is both stable and has strong predictive power, 
                as evidenced by the high R-squared value and low residual standard error observed in the testing set.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The voter turnout model for 2020 displays a high R-squared value of 0.9154, indicating good predictive 
                power with over 91.54% of the variance in voter turnout being explained by the model. This strong fit 
                underscores the significant impact of the variables included, especially the voter turnout from 2016. 
                The residual standard error was low at 0.01991 across 27 degrees of freedom, suggesting that the predicted 
                values were very close to the actual values.

        <p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
        <p>The primary objective of this study is to identify the key factors that significantly influence voter turnout 
            in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. A total of six factors were investigated, and through the computation 
            of RMSE values, three were found to be significant contributors to enhancing the model's fit.</p>
        <p>The analysis addresses the initial questions posed: first, whether a substantial relationship exists between 
            historical voter turnout data and the 2020 election turnout, and second, whether various socio-economic and 
            political factors prove significant in predicting voter turnout. Examining the red_OLS model summary reveals 
            the significance of the voter_turnout_2016 variable in predicting the voter_turnout_2020, indicated by the 
            three asterisks (***), which signifies its pronounced influence compared to other variables.</p>
        <p>Yielding a relatively high adjusted R-Squared value of 0.9154, our final model demonstrates that independent 
            variables maintain statistical significance. With p-values below the significance level of 0.05, 
            meaningful conclusions can confidently be drawn from the study. </p>
        <p>The study's findings offer practical implications for political campaigns and policymakers seeking to enhance 
            voter engagement and turnout. Recommendations include focusing on the education and economic well-being of 
            the electorate, as well as understanding the significant impact of historical voting patterns. Prospective 
            campaigners and political analysts can leverage this research to tailor their strategies based on the 
            identified influential factors and thereby more effectively target interventions aimed at increasing voter 
            participation.</p>
