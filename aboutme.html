        <p>Hello! I'm Riley McNair, a computer science student at the University of British Columbia, 
            where I am currently pursuing a second-degree Bachelor's in Computer Science.  My interest in computer science began during the 
            end of my first undergraduate degree in Political Science. While I thoroughly enjoyed 
            studying political science and economics, it was the analytical courses—focusing on data analysis and statistical inference—that 
            really interested me. </p>
        <p>Looking to build on this interest, I transitioned into UBC’s BCS program, a second-degree program designed for students shifting 
            into computer science from other fields. Transitioning from political science to computer science was a significant shift for me, but I 
            was excited to immerse myself completely in learning about computers and software development.</p>
        <p> Throughout my academic and professional experiences, I have worked on a variety of projects that blend my analytical skills 
            with my technical. During my 8-month co-op term, I applied my SQL and data analysis skills to extract and analyze datasets, 
            creating advanced queries that supported data-driven decision-making. I also utilized Python for hypothesis testing and 
            statistical sampling, helping evaluate trends in data. Additionally, I used Python, R, and Power BI to design 
            visualizations and detailed reports used by internal teams and external departments.</p>

        <p><strong>My Academic Projects:</strong></p>
        <p>- <strong>Political Candidate Information Kiosk:</strong> In this academic project, I designed a user-friendly GUI to simulate a voting system, 
            utilizing JSON for efficient data storage and retrieval. This experience deepened my understanding of user interface design and 
            underscored the importance of intuitive navigation in software applications.</p>
        <p>- <strong>Prediction Model-Voter Turnout:</strong>  This personal project involved developing a prediction model using R to forecast voter 
            turnout in the US 2020 presidential election. My approach included advanced statistical modeling techniques such as ridge regression, multiple 
            linear regression, and forward selection, culminating in the application of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. This project not only enhanced 
            my analytical skills but also my ability to interpret and model complex data sets.</p>
        <p>- <strong>Relational Database for a Ski Resort:</strong> As part of my university coursework, I developed a relational database 
            system to optimize ski resort operations. The project involved designing an ER diagram, implementing a relational schema, and 
            normalizing the database to ensure data consistency. Using SQL, I created queries to manage ski lift operations, class scheduling, 
            patron details, and instructor assignments. The system was then integrated into a user-friendly front-end interface to facilitate 
            resort management, maintenance tracking, and data analytics.</p>   

        <p>I'm always eager to learn more and am currently interested in data science, data analytics, and machine learning. When I'm not coding or studying, 
            I enjoy exploring everything beautiful British Columbia has to offer from skiing, to hiking and backpacking. For quieter moments, 
            I find joy in baking, reading, and crocheting.</p>

        <p>Thank you for visiting my site!</p>
